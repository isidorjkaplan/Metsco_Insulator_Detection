This network was a first attempt, trained on the data of 3 insulators from multiple backgrounds and then tested on a few pictures from the same set which were taken out before training for validation. The accuracy was acceptabe, but the reliability of the results is unknown and so I'm gonna try another set with different data. The training set was "set1," validation images from same set.
